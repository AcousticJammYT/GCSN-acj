If you want to use this to make your own server and client and release it...

then do it... dont credit me... just do it... its open source for a damn reason.

# The server

drag the server folder onto love2d

like how you run KRISTAL

# The client

It should be automatic.

just put the stuff in scripts in a library or your mod

alternatively, install as a mod and use [plugin loader](<https://github.com/polypoyo/kristal-pluginloader>)
